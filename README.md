# Breast Cancer Exosome Biomarker Discovery

Bioinformatics analysis pipeline for identifying candidate protein biomarkers in breast cancer–derived exosomes using public proteomics data.

---

# Biological Background

Extracellular vesicles (exosomes) play important roles in cancer biology, mediating intercellular communication, metastasis, and immune modulation.

Proteins packaged into tumor-derived exosomes may serve as **non-invasive biomarkers detectable through liquid biopsy**.

This project investigates whether **exosomal proteomic profiles can distinguish breast cancer–associated samples from normal controls**, and prioritizes candidate proteins potentially involved in tumor-related vesicle biology.

# Analysis Workflow

The bioinformatics pipeline consists of several stages:

1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Quality control and replicate validation
3. Protein filtering (peptide count and sequence coverage)
4. Log2 transformation of LFQ intensities
5. Missing value modeling (MNAR detection)
6. Left-shifted Gaussian imputation
7. Median normalization
8. Differential expression analysis using limma
9. Principal Component Analysis
10. Protein–protein interaction network construction using the STRING database
11. Network topology analysis (degree, betweenness centrality)
12. PCA-based multi-feature integration
13. Composite driver score calculation
14. Functional annotation and literature mining

# Key Findings

The prioritization pipeline identified **21 candidate driver proteins** associated with breast cancer exosome proteomic signatures.

Top driver proteins include:

* MVB12A
* CHMP5
* CHMP4B
* CHMP2B
* VPS37B
* VPS4B
* TSG101
* CHMP2A
* VPS28

Many of these proteins belong to the **ESCRT machinery**, which is responsible for membrane remodeling and exosome biogenesis.

These results suggest that **alterations in ESCRT-associated pathways may contribute to tumor-related exosome production in breast cancer cells**.
